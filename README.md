From the figure, it can be seen that CDF of failure is very low in case of manufacturer-B when compared with that of manufacturer-A during the first 5 years. Therefore number of devices failing during these years in case of manufacturer-B is lesser than that of manufacturer-A. It can be concluded that for the same MTTF of 5years LEDs developed by manufacturer-B is having better reliability than that of manufacturer-A.
